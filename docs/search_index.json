This technical document contains information describing how data was collected, processed, and analysed. This document will be updated as necessary. Readers can find the most up-to-date results on the ABMI Biodiversity Browser (https://www.abmi.ca/home/data-analytics/biobrowser-home). "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Expert Review", " Chapter 2 Introduction The Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) began deploying Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs) in 2015 to capture the vocalizations of song-birds. These observations have been incorporated into the ABMIs species distribution modeling (SDM) framework that uses supplementary databases (e.g., Boreal Avian Monitoring Project) and methods (e.g., river fork data from 2007-2015) to identify species habitat relationships with native landcover, human footprint, and climate. In addition to capturing vocalizing song-birds, the ABMI has begun identifying vocalizing amphibians. In collaboration with the Bioacoustic Unit, recordings were collected between 2013 and 2021 and are used to create SDMs for vocalizing amphibians. The goal for these models is to identify relationships with native and human footprint landcover types, calculate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance, and predict the probability of occurrence across the province under both the current landscape condition and a reference condition. This information can be used internally, by stakeholders, or the general public to identify where amphibians are occurring the in the province and how they are impacted by land use changes. 2.1 Expert Review As amphibians are a high profile taxon within the province, the ABMI is implementing a phased rollout of data related to amphibians: Phase 1 (completed May \\(1^{st}\\), 2021) involved updating our Biodiversity Browser to include occurrence maps of all vocalizing amphibian species detected at ABMI sites (https://abmi.ca); Phase 2 (completed September \\(1^{st}\\), 2021) involved the development of SDM and an engagement period with local amphibian experts; Phase 3 (completed January \\(31^{st}\\), 2022) involved synthesizing the advice identified during the expert review phase and updating the models accordingly. The final phase (TBD) will involve incorporating surveys collected by the Bioacoustic Unit and to publish the final set of SDM on the ABMI Biodiversity Browser (https://www.abmi.ca/home/data-analytics/biobrowser-home). We asked the experts to comment on the following topics: Are there gaps in how ARU recordings are currently summarized? Do the habitat relationships identified in the SDMs align with your natural history knowledge of these species? Do the spatial predictions created by the model align with your natural history knowledge of these species current distribution in the province? Are there key habitat or climate variables you feel are essential to capturing amphibian distributions that are currently not included? Would you be comfortable using these results to inform your own personal work? The feedback provided by the experts was synthesized and issues were addressed whenever possible. These models will be under continual development, so we expect improvements as move amphibian surveys are completed and new data layers are made available. We would like to acknowledge and thank our group of experts as their comments during the review process improved the quality of our species models. "],["processing-of-vocalization-events.html", "Chapter 3 Processing of vocalization events", " Chapter 3 Processing of vocalization events The ARU data used to construct these SDM have come from the following ABMI surveys; Ecosystem Health sites (2015-2021); Adopt-a-Camera/ARU (2017); Citizen Science ARU (2016); Edge-Interior (2017); Northern Focal Areas (2019-2020); Southern Focal Areas (2020); Amphibian Monitoring (2020); and Operation Grassland (2015). Data collected through the Bioacoustic Units Wetlands surveys (2013-2019) was also incorporated. Due to the differences in how ARU data was collected between projects, and the time of deployment, recordings were standardized using the following procedure: Only the first minute of each recording event was listened to. Recordings with high levels of noises due to precipitation, wind conditions, or industrial and background activity were excluded permitting this metadata was available. To replicate the conditions of a midnight survey, we filtered for recording events between 23:30-02:30 hours. We acknowledge that this survey interval may not be optimal for all vocalizing amphibians. Therefore, the calling phenology of each species will be investigated once sufficient data is available. Only species that occurred at greater than 20 ARUs were maintained for analysis. For all species with sufficient data, we assessed the seasonality window of calls by aggregating the percentage of detections across ARUs by Julian calendar day. Local temperature during the recording event and Julian calendar day was used to account for the variation in detectability through the survey window. After cleaning the data, there were 12330 unique recordings used for creating SDMs based on vegetation data (Boreal, Foothills, Canadian Shield, Rocky Mountain, and Parkland natural regions), and 4396 unique recordings used for creating SDMs based on soil data (Parkland and Grassland natural regions). "],["species-distribution-models.html", "Chapter 4 Species Distribution Models 4.1 Landcover information 4.2 Vegetation based species models 4.3 Soil based species models 4.4 Reporting Regions", " Chapter 4 Species Distribution Models 4.1 Landcover information Landcover information was extracted from the ABMI detailed Wall-to-Wall vegetation and Human Footprint GIS layer. The proportional area of vegetation with broad stand age classes and human disturbance classes (Table. 1) were determined within a 150m buffer by manual interpretation of 1:30,000 aerial photos and SPOT satellite imagery. In regions where vegetation classes do not capture the variation in species distributions, the proportional area of soils, classified into seven broad categories (Table. 1), based on a simplified version of the Agricultural Region of Alberta Soil Inventory Database was used. In addition, we included a term to capture if a site was naturally treed (probability of aspen). Climatic variables (Table. ) were derived from historical weather station data (500 \\(m^{2}\\) spatial resolution) using the parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model (PRISM) method. As amphibians require water for successful breeding, we also calculated the proportion of water within a 1 \\(km^{2}\\) buffer around each site.To enable provincial wide predictions, the above information was also summarizes as a 1 \\(km^{2}\\) raster for the entire province. SDMs were created for all species which were detected in at least 20 ARUs within the analysis region (vegetation or soil) using a model selection framework. We created a set of statistcal models (binomial generalized linear models) to relate the relative abundance (presence/absence) of each species to two sets of variables: landcover (vegetation, soil or human footprint) and climate (climate normals and spatial location). This framework allowed us to create models for a large number of species while selecting models for each species that are only as complex as the data supports. For example, the models for a rarer species with few records may not be able to separate different age classes or even broad stand types. In these cases, all age classes or several stand types therefore have the same average value in the resulting habitat model.

These areas are predominately impacted by forestry footprint; 2) The Prairie region is composed of the Grassland and Parkland natural regions, the southern portion of the Dry Mixedwood natural subregion, and the eastern portion of the Montane natural subregion.
