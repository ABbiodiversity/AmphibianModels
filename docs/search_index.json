This technical document contains information describing how data was collected, processed, and analysed. This document will be updated as necessary. Readers can find the most up-to-date results on the ABMI Biodiversity Browser (https://www.abmi.ca/home/data-analytics/biobrowser-home). We would like to acknowledge that this work would not be possible without the dedication of the past and present ABMI staff. Without our field staff, geospatial experts, and ecologists, we would not be able to perform this work.

These observations have been incorporated into the ABMIs species distribution modeling (SDM) framework that uses supplementary databases (e.g., Boreal Avian Monitoring Project) and methods (e.g., river fork data from 2007-2015) to identify species habitat relationships with native landcover, human footprint, and climate. In addition to capturing vocalizing song-birds, the ABMI has begun identifying vocalizing amphibians. In collaboration with the Bioacoustic Unit, recordings were collected between 2013 and 2021 and are used to create SDMs for vocalizing amphibians. The goal for these models is to identify relationships with native and human footprint landcover types, calculate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance, and predict the probability of occurrence across the province under both the current landscape condition and a reference condition. This information can be used internally, by stakeholders, or the general public to identify where amphibians are occurring the in the province and how they are impacted by land use changes. 2.2 Amphibians 101 Alberta is home to ten amphibian species: two salamanders, three true frogs, three true toads, one tree frog, and one spadefoot. This unique group of species use their skin to breathe and absorb water and require both aquatic and terrestrial habitats to thrive. During the breeding season, male frogs and toads will begin vocalizing in order to attract mates. The timing of their vocalizations can be dependent on the time of year, local temperature conditions, and even rain events. These vocalizing periods can be captured using ARU, but only reflect part of an amphibians habitat requirements. Unique characteristics within wetlands (e.g., salt concentrations, fish presence) and terrestrial habitats occupied outside of the breeding season are not captured by ARUs. 2.3 Expert Review As amphibians are a high profile taxon within the province, the ABMI is implementing a phased rollout of data related to amphibians: Phase 1 (completed May 1st, 2021) involved updating our Biodiversity Browser to include occurrence maps of all vocalizing amphibian species detected at ABMI sites (https://www.abmi.ca/home/data-analytics/biobrowser-home); Phase 2 (completed September 1st, 2021) involved the development of SDM and an engagement period with local amphibian experts; Phase 3 (completed January 31st, 2022) involved synthesizing the advice identified during the expert review phase and updating the models accordingly. The final phase (TBD) will involve incorporating surveys collected by the Bioacoustic Unit and to publish the final set of SDM on the ABMI Biodiversity Browser. We asked the experts to comment on the following topics: Are there gaps in how ARU recordings are currently summarized? Do the habitat relationships identified in the SDMs align with your natural history knowledge of these species? Do the spatial predictions created by the model align with your natural history knowledge of these species current distribution in the province? Are there key habitat or climate variables you feel are essential to capturing amphibian distributions that are currently not included? Would you be comfortable using these results to inform your own personal work? The feedback provided by the experts was synthesized and issues were addressed whenever possible. These models will be under continual development, so we expect improvements as move amphibian surveys are completed and new data layers are made available. We would like to acknowledge and thank our group of experts as their comments during the review process improved the quality of our species models. "],["processing-of-vocalization-events.html", "3 Processing of vocalization events", " 3 Processing of vocalization events The ARU data used to construct these SDM have come from the following ABMI surveys; Ecosystem Health sites (2015-2021); Adopt-a-Camera/ARU (2017); Citizen Science ARU (2016); Edge-Interior (2017); Northern Focal Areas (2019-2020); Southern Focal Areas (2020); Amphibian Monitoring (2020); and Operation Grassland (2015). Data collected through the Bioacoustic Units Wetlands surveys (2013-2019) was also incorporated. Due to the differences in how ARU data was collected between projects, and the time of deployment, recordings were standardized using the following procedure: Only the first minute of each recording event was listened to. Recordings with high levels of noises due to precipitation, wind conditions, or industrial and background activity were excluded permitting this metadata was available. To replicate the conditions of a midnight survey, we filtered for recording events between 23:30-02:30 hours. We acknowledge that this survey interval may not be optimal for all vocalizing amphibians. Therefore, the calling phenology of each species will be investigated once sufficient data is available. Only species that occurred at greater than 20 ARUs were maintained for analysis. For all species with sufficient data, we assessed the seasonality window of calls by aggregating the percentage of detections across ARUs by Julian calendar day. Local temperature during the recording event and Julian calendar day was used to account for the variation in detectability throughout the survey window. After cleaning the data, there were 12330 unique recordings used for creating SDMs based on vegetation data (Boreal, Foothills, Canadian Shield, Rocky Mountain, and Parkland natural regions), and 4396 unique recordings used for creating SDMs based on soil data (Parkland and Grassland natural regions). "],["species-distribution-models.html", "4 Species Distribution Models 4.1 Landcover information 4.2 Reporting Regions", " 4 Species Distribution Models 4.1 Landcover information Landcover information was extracted from the ABMI detailed Wall-to-Wall vegetation and Human Footprint GIS layer. The proportional area of vegetation with broad stand age classes and human disturbance classes were determined within a 150m buffer by manual interpretation of 1:30,000 aerial photos and SPOT satellite imagery. In regions where vegetation classes do not capture the variation in species distributions, the proportional area of soils, classified into seven broad categories, based on a simplified version of the Agricultural Region of Alberta Soil Inventory Database was used. In addition, we included a term to capture if a site was naturally treed (probability of aspen). Climatic variables were derived from historical weather station data (500 m2 spatial resolution) using the parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model (PRISM) method. As amphibians require water for successful breeding, we also calculated the proportion of water within a 1 km2 buffer around each site.To enable provincial wide predictions, the above information was also summarizes as a 1 km2 raster for the entire province.

We created a set of statistcal models (binomial generalized linear models) to relate the relative abundance (presence/absence) of each species to two sets of variables: landcover (vegetation, soil or human footprint) and climate (climate normals and spatial location). This framework allowed us to create models for a large number of species while selecting models for each species that are only as complex as the data supports. For example, the models for a rarer species with few records may not be able to separate different age classes or even broad stand types. In these cases, all age classes or several stand types therefore have the same average value in the resulting habitat model. For those looking for more technical details, the src file in this repository contains all scripts used to develop these models. Raw data can be acquired by contacting Brandon Allen (brandon.allen@ualberta.ca) 4.2 Reporting Regions We summarize our SDM for two reporting regions: 1) The Forested region is composed of the Boreal, Canadian Shield, Rocky Mountain (excluding eastern portion of the montane region), and Foothills natural regions in addition to the northern portion of the Dry Mixedwood natural subregion. These areas are predominately impacted by forestry footprint; 2) The Prairie region is composed of the Grassland and Parkland natural regions, the southern portion of the Dry Mixedwood natural subregion, and the eastern portion of the Montane natural subregion. These areas were grouped together due to agriculture being the predominate anthropogenic disturbance. The boundaries of the forested and prairie reporting regions used for calculating sector effects.

The change in predicted relative abundance of Wood Frog as a function of vegetation, soil, human footprint, and space/cliamte across Alberta between reference and current condition (2018 footprint). 12.7 Sector Effects Local sector effects predict the change to species relative abundance inside areas that have been disturbed by each sector (human footprint type) compared to the habitat it replaced (modeled reference condition with no human footprint). Sector effect values less than 0% indicate habitat suitability is reduced (predicted related abundance is lower) compared to reference conditions, and values more than 0% indicate habitat suitability is improved (predicted relative abundance is higher) compared to reference conditions. Regional sector effects predict the change in the total regional population by industrial sector for species. This incorporates the area of the footprint, the native habitats where the footprint occurs, and the species response to a particular footprint. Regional population effect values less than 0% indicate a predicted decrease in the regional population due to a particular sectors footprint, and values greater than 0% indicate a predicted increase. 12.7.1 Forested Region We predict that Wood Frog has local positive response to all sectors within this region. However, this does not translate to the regional effects where we observe small increaes. Regional (left) and local (right) sector effects for Wood Frog within the Forested Region 12.7.2 Prairie Region We predict that Wood Frog has local positive responses to all sectors within this region. However, the responses are strongest for agriculture and forestry. In addition, we observe a moderate regional effect of agriculture.
