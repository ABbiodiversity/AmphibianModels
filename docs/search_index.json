These observations have been incorporated into the ABMIs species distribution modeling (SDM) framework that uses supplementary databases (e.g., Boreal Avian Monitoring Project) and methods (e.g., river fork data from 2007-2015) to identify species habitat relationships with native landcover, human footprint, and climate. Though the primary reason for deploying ARUs was to monitoring song-birds, the ABMI has begun using this methodology to monitor vocalizing amphibians. In addition, we are collaborating with the Bioacoustic Unit (BU) to incorporate their recordings of amphibians collected as part of wetland surveys between 2013 and 2021. With more than 10,000 individual recordings, our goal was to develop SDMs to identify relationships with native and human footprint landcover types, calculate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance, and predict the probability of occurrence across the province under both the current landscape condition and a reference condition. This information can be used internally, by stakeholders, or the general public to identify where amphibians are occurring in the province and how they are impacted by land use changes. 2.2 Amphibians 101 Alberta is home to ten amphibian species: two salamanders, three true frogs, three true toads, one tree frog, and one species of spadefoot. This unique group of species use their skin to breathe and absorb water. They also require both aquatic and terrestrial habitats to thrive. During the breeding season, male frogs and toads will begin vocalizing in order to attract mates. The timing of their vocalizations can be dependent on the time of year, local temperature conditions, and even rain events. These vocalizing periods can be captured using ARUs but only reflect part of an amphibians habitat requirements. Unique characteristics within wetlands (e.g., salt concentrations, fish presence) and terrestrial habitats occupied outside of the breeding season are not captured by ARUs. 2.3 Expert Review As amphibians are a high profile taxon within the province, the ABMI has implemented a phased roll out of data: Phase 1 (completed May 1st, 2021): Updated our Biodiversity Browser with basic occurrence maps for all vocalizing amphibians detected at ABMI sites (https://www.abmi.ca/home/data-analytics/biobrowser-home). Phase 2 (completed September 1st, 2021): Developed preliminary SDMs and completed an engagement period with local amphibian experts. Phase 3 (completed January 31st, 2022): Synthesized the advice identified during the expert review phase and updated our SDMs. Phase 4 (TBD): Public release of newly collected occurrence data and updated SDMs alongside the updated Biodiversity Browser. During our engagement period with experts, we asked them to comment on the following topics: Are there gaps in how ARU recordings are summarized? Do the habitat relationships identified in the SDMs align with your natural history knowledge of these species? Do the spatial predictions created by the model align with your natural history knowledge of these species current distribution in the province? Are there key habitat or climate variables you feel are essential to capturing amphibian distributions that are currently not included? Would you be comfortable using these results to inform your own personal work? The feedback provided by the experts was synthesized and concerns were addressed whenever possible. These models will be under continual development, so we expect improvements as more amphibian surveys are completed and new data layers are made available. We would like to acknowledge and thank our group of experts as their comments during the review process improved the quality of our species models. "],["data-collection.html", "3 Data Collection 3.1 ARU Deployments 3.2 Processing of vocalization events", " 3 Data Collection 3.1 ARU Deployments The ARU data used to construct our SDM came from two primary sources: ABMI and the Bioacoustic Unit. Surveys collected by the ABMI was done across the following projects: Ecosystem Health sites (2015-2021) Adopt-a-Camera/ARU (2017) Citizen Science ARU (2016) Edge-Interior (2017) Northern Focal Areas (2019-2020) Southern Focal Areas (2020) Amphibian Monitoring (2020) Operation Grassland (2015). In total, there were 3303 unique sampling events. ARU surveys conducted by the ABMI between 2015-2021. Surveys collected by the Bioacoustic Unit came from their Wetland survey projects (2013-2019) which collected data for 1324 unique sampling events. ARU surveys conducted by the BU between 2013-2019. 3.2 Processing of vocalization events Vocalization data was processed through the WildTrax platform (https://www.wildtrax.ca/). However, due to the differences in how ARU data was collected between projects (e.g., listening time), and the time of deployment, recordings were standardized using the following procedure: Only observations detected within the first minute of a recording was used. Recordings with high levels of noises due to precipitation, wind conditions, or industrial and background activity were excluded permitting this metadata was available. To replicate the conditions of a midnight survey, we filtered for recording events between 23:30-02:30 hours. We acknowledge that this survey interval may not be optimal for all vocalizing amphibians. Therefore, the daily calling phenology of each species will be investigated once sufficient data is available. For all species with sufficient data (greater than 20 detections), we assessed the seasonality window of calls by aggregating the percentage of detections across ARUs by Julian calendar day. Local temperature during the recording event and Julian calendar day were used to account for detection variability throughout the survey window. After cleaning the data, there were 14,336 unique recordings used for creating our species models. "],["species-distribution-models.html", "4 Species Distribution Models 4.1 Vegetation 4.2 Soil 4.3 Human Footprint 4.4 Climate 4.5 Species models 4.6 Reporting Regions", " 4 Species Distribution Models Depending on data availability, we construct two sets of species models. The vegetation based model (Section 4.1) is created using sites except for those in the Grassland natural region. The soil based model (Section 4.2) includes sites that fall within the Grassland and Parkland natural regions, plus the southern portion of the Dry mixedwood natural subregion. Landcover information was extracted from the ABMI detailed Wall-to-Wall vegetation and Human Footprint GIS layer (Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute 2017). The area of vegetation, soil, and human disturbance were determined within a 150m buffer by manual interpretation of 1:30,000 aerial photos and SPOT satellite imagery (Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute 2016) and transformed into proportions. 4.1 Vegetation We classified forested vegetation into five broad stand types with age classes (09 years, 1019 years, 2039 years, 4059 years, 60-79 years, 80-99 years, 100-119 years, 120139 years, and +140 years): White Spruce. This is really upland non-pine conifer. It is dominated by white spruce, but also includes other upland conifer species like Engelmann spruce or hybrids, balsam fir and Douglas-fir where those species occur. Pine. Any pine species. Deciduous. Any stand type dominated by deciduous trees, primarily upland but including some areas of lowland deciduous. Mixedwood. Any stand mapped as mixedwood. Black Spruce (Treed Bog). Lowland conifer stands, which may include species other than black spruce, but excluding stands where the dominant tree is larch. We also define nine habitat types without age classes: Treed Fen. Lowland stands with larch present. Treed Swamp. Lowland stands with a mixture of coniferous and deciduous species. Shrubby Swamp. Shrubby wetlands that are not either fens or bogs. Shrubby Bog. Bogs dominated by shrubby vegetation. Shrubby Fen. Rich and poor shrubby fens. Graminoid Fen. Composed of grass fens. Marsh. Shrub. Upland edaphic shrub areas. Mapping of this type is imprecise, and some early seral post-fire stands may also be included here. Grass. Upland edaphic grass areas, or herbaceous areas. Mapping of this type is imprecise, and some early seral post-fire stands may also be included here. 4.2 Soil Soil classes were compiled into seven broad categories: Loamy. Sandy/Loamy. Rapid Drain. Limy, badlands, gravel, sandhills, saline, and shallow gravel soils. Clay. Clay and sub-irrigated soils. Thin Break. Blowout. Blowouts and saline lowland soils. Other. All other soil types with low sample sizes (e.g., lotic and lentic soil). 4.3 Human Footprint We classified human footprint features into 12 classes: Harvest Areas. Contains the same age classes as natural stands (up to 80 years) and references to the time since harvest. Currently, we combine mixedwood and deciduous harvest areas. Cultivation. Cultivated cropland planted with annual crop species. Includes areas included in crop rotations. Tame Pasture. Land where soil has been disturbed and planted with perennial grass species for grazing livestock. Rough Pasture. Areas where forests and/or shrubs have been removed to allow native or introduced grass to flourish for the grazing of livestock. Well sites. Includes all active and abandoned well sites. Does not distinguish between the various types of well sites (e.g., oil, gas, bitumen, etc). Rural. Includes footprint that occurs in a rural setting but is not associated with industrial activities (e.g., country residence). Urban Industrial. These are areas intermixed with urban residential and urban industrial features in cities, towns, and villages. Industrial (Rural). Industrial activities that predominately occur in rural settings. This can include features such as mills, oil and gas plants, and housing camps. Soft Linear (Transportation). All vegetated verges associated with road and rail features. Soft Linear (Energy). Pipelines and transmission lines. Seismic Lines. Includes both narrow and wide seismic lines. Hard Linear. All road and rail hard surfaces. 4.4 Climate Climatic variables were derived from historical weather station data (500 m2 spatial resolution) using the parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model (PRISM) method (Daly et al. 2002). As amphibians require water for successful breeding, we also calculated the proportion of water within a 1 km2 buffer around each site. In addition, we included a term to capture the probability that an area supports trees (probability of aspen). To enable provincial wide predictions, all landcover and climate information was summarized as a 1 km2 raster for the entire province. Table 4.1: Table of climatic information used to create the species distribution models. Climatic Spatial Annual Heat Moisture Index Proportion of Water Frost-free Period Latitude Monthly Reference Evaporation Longitude Mean Annual Precipitation Mean Annual Temperature Mean Coldest Month Temperature Mean Warmest Month Temperature Probability of Aspen 4.5 Species models SDMs were created for all species which were detected at a minimum of 20 ARUs within the analysis region (vegetation or soil) using a model selection framework (Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute 2015). We created a set of statistical models (binomial generalized linear models) to relate the relative abundance (presence/absence) of each species to two sets of variables: landcover (vegetation/soil and human footprint) and climate (climate normals and spatial location). This framework allowed us to create models for a large number of species while selecting models for each species that are only as complex as the data supports. For example, the models for a rarer species with few records may not be able to separate different age classes or even broad stand types. In these cases, all age classes or several stand types therefore have the same average value in the resulting habitat model. We assessed model fit using AUC and only present species models with at least moderate predictive ability (AUC &gt; 0.7). 4.5.1 Overlap Region For species with both vegetation and soil based models, we weighted the predictions in regions where either model would be suitable (i.e., Parkland and Dry mixedwood). This weight is based on the probability an area supports trees (pAspen), the amount of unknown soil (pSoil), and the amount of treed areas (pFor). \\(North weight = \\frac{pAspen}{pAspen - (1-pFor)}\\) \\(South weight = (1-pAspen) * (1-pSoil) * (1-pFor)\\) We rescale these two weights (\\(North weight = \\frac{North weight}{North weight + South weight}\\)) so that: \\(South weight = North weight - 1\\). Distribution of weights used for averaging predictions created from the vegetation and soil based models. 4.5.2 Limitations The explanatory variables are confounded. We have limited ability to separate the effects of each vegetation and human footprint type, and spatial and climate variables. In addition to the challenges generating uncertainty in the individual values, ABMI is not an experimental study. We do not design and manipulate habitat and human footprint types, and simply use what is sampled in the province. As a result, habitat and human footprint types are partially confounded with geographic location and climate variables. Our modeling separates out these effects as best as possible, but without impossible province-wide experiments, we can never be sure how well we have estimated the separate habitat, human footprint and geographic/climate effects. We use the same model set for all species. Our model selection approach weights different models in a model set based on the support provided by each species data. However, we use the same set of models for all species. As there are only eight species of vocalizing amphibians in Alberta, we are exploring options for creating customized models for this group. There are errors in species identification. Vocalization events from amphibians can be misidentified due to low volume or similarity in species calls. These errors in identifications can reduce the accuracy of our models. The vegetation and soil classification is simplified and contains errors. ABMIs vegetation map is compiled from various sources, not all of which cover the entire province. Some layers are less accurate than others. Also, even if individual polygons are accurate, their boundaries may not be precise, and many ABMI sites fall on the edges of vegetation polygons. Resulting error in the vegetation types at sites increases error in the habitat models. Some habitat types may have additional challenges. Grass and shrub sites in the North, for example, may be true permanent open habitats, but the same designation is often given to early seral stages of forested sites after fire. Grass and shrub sites in the prairies are also poorly mapped. Mixedwood stands are also poorly mapped, because they represent a gradient between deciduous and upland conifer stands, which can often change as a stand ages. No other effects of human activities are included in our models. Many sites in the Prairie region are grazed to varying degrees but this information is not available. Thus grazing effects cannot be included in our models, and if grazing differs among native habitat types the effects confound those difference. Any wide-scale human effects, like pollution away from visible human footprint or recent climate change, are also not included in our modeling. Additionally, we only include effects of footprint at the local scale (150m) we sample at. Due to sample size constraints and confounding among variables, we do not include any additional effects that might be caused by human footprint in the larger surrounding area. 4.6 Reporting Regions We summarize our SDM for two reporting regions: The Forested region is composed of the Boreal, Canadian Shield, Rocky Mountain (excluding eastern portion of the Montane subregion), and Foothills natural regions in addition to the northern portion of the Dry Mixedwood natural subregion. These areas were grouped together due to forestry being the predominate footprint type The Prairie region is composed of the Grassland and Parkland natural regions, the southern portion of the Dry Mixedwood natural subregion, and the eastern portion of the Montane natural subregion. These areas were grouped together due to agriculture being the predominate anthropogenic disturbance. The boundaries of the forested and prairie reporting regions used for calculating sector effects.

In addition, they are also known to occupy flooded agricultural fields and small ponds in urban areas as breeding sites. This aligns with the vegetation based SDM where we predicted the species to have moderate to high abundances in both native wetland land cover and human footprint. Interestingly, we predicted high abundances of Boreal Chorus Frog in young cut-blocks. These habitats could have altered landscape properties that allow for shallow ephemeral ponds to form, thus creating attractive breeding sites. 5.1 Distribution The Boreal Chorus Frog was abundant in our data set and was detected at 68.6% of 1648 survey locations.

This species was vocalizing between early April to early July, with a peak calling frequency in mid May. The frequency of detections across sites aggregated by Julian calendar day. 5.3 Vegetation Models We were able to create a SDM using the vegetation landcover information with good fit (AUC = 0.81). The vegetation based model indicated that this species is predicted to have high abundance in native wetland (bogs, fens, swamps) and open upland (grass, shrub) habitats.

We predicted the change of species relative abundance inside areas that have been disturbed by each linear feature class compared to the habitat it replaced (modeled reference condition with no human footprint). Effects less than 0% indicate habitat suitability is reduced (predicted related abundance is lower) compared to reference conditions, and values more than 0% indicate habitat suitability is improved (predicted relative abundance is higher) compared to reference conditions.

However, we observed decreased abundance in energy seismic, energy soft linear, and transportation soft linear features based on the soil models right). 5.6 Predicted Abundance Under reference conditions, Boreal Chorus Frog is predicted to be moderately abundant throughout all natural regions except the Rocky Mountains (left). Under current landcover conditions (2018 footprint) we observe high abundance throughout the Grassland and Parkland natural regions (right). Overall, we predicted increases in suitable habitat for Boreal Chorus Frog throughout the Parkland natural region.

Sector effect values less than 0% indicate habitat suitability is reduced (predicted related abundance is lower) compared to reference conditions, and values more than 0% indicate habitat suitability is improved (predicted relative abundance is higher) compared to reference conditions. Regional sector effects represent the change in the total regional population by industrial sector for species. This incorporates the area of the footprint, the native habitats where the footprint occurs, and the species response to a particular footprint.

The occurrence of Western Toad detected between 2013-2021 at ABMI and BU locations. 11.2 Seasonality With 324 unique recordings of Western Toad, we were able to determine an optimal survey period. This species was vocalizing between early April to late July, with a peak calling frequency in mid May. The frequency of detections across sites aggregated by Julian calendar day. 11.3 Vegetation Models We were able to create a SDM using the vegetation landcover information with good fit (AUC = 0.87). The vegetation based model indicated that this species is predicted to have high abundance in native moderate aged Pine and Deciduous forests, and old Treed Bogs. This is in addition to high abundance in cut-blocks and moderate abundance in rough and tame pastures. The predicted relative abundance (bars) of Western Toad as a function of vegetation and human footprint types in the forested region. Black vertical lines represent 90% confidence intervals and blue vertical lines are added to forest types where harvesting occurs and shows the predicted species abundance in harvest areas of various ages. The spatial and climate component indicated negative relationships with longitude and a non-linear relationship with the amount of open water. The spatial and climate coefficients from the vegetation based model for Western Toad. 11.4 Soil Models We were able to create a SDM using the soil landcover information with good fit (AUC = 0.94). The soil based models predicted higher abundance in rapid drain, thin break, and blow out soils while low abundance for all footprint types. There was positive effect between treed and non-treed sites. The predicted relative abundance (bars) of Western Toad as a function of soil and human footprint types in the prairie region. Black vertical lines represent 90% confidence intervals.

The spatial and climate component indicated positive relationships with latitude and a negative relationship with longitude. The spatial and climate coefficients from the soil based model for Western Toad. 11.5 Linear Features We estimate the impacts of four types of linear features: Energy seismic lines (wide and narrow), energy soft linear (transmission lines, pipelines), hard linear (roads and rails), and transportation soft linear (road verges). We predicted the change to species relative abundance inside areas that have been disturbed by each linear feature class compared to the habitat it replaced (modeled reference condition with no human footprint). Effects less than 0% indicate habitat suitability is reduced (predicted related abundance is lower) compared to reference conditions, and values more than 0% indicate habitat suitability is improved (predicted relative abundance is higher) compared to reference conditions. The vegetation (left) and soil (right) based models indicate that Western Toad decreased in hard linear features, and increased in all other types. 11.6 Predicted Abundance Under reference conditions, Western Toad is predicted to be moderately abundant throughout the Foothills, Rocky Mountains, and west-central portions of the Boreal natural regions (left). Under current landcover conditions (2018 footprint) we predicted a similar distribution.

Sector effect values less than 0% indicate habitat suitability is reduced (predicted related abundance is lower) compared to reference conditions, and values more than 0% indicate habitat suitability is improved (predicted relative abundance is higher) compared to reference conditions. Regional sector effects represent the change in the total regional population by industrial sector for species. This incorporates the area of the footprint, the native habitats where the footprint occurs, and the species response to a particular footprint. Regional population effect values less than 0% indicate a predicted decrease in the regional population due to a particular sectors footprint, and values greater than 0% indicate a predicted increase. 11.7.1 Forested Region We predicted that Western Toad has local positive response to the energy, forestry, and transportation sectors.
