These observations have been incorporated into the ABMIs species distribution modeling (SDM) framework that uses supplementary databases (e.g., Boreal Avian Monitoring Project) and methods (e.g., river fork data from 2007-2015) to identify species habitat relationships with native landcover, human footprint, and climate. In addition to capturing vocalizing song-birds, the ABMI has begun identifying vocalizing amphibians. Recordings collected by the ABMI between 2015 and 2019 have been compiled to create SDMs for vocalizing amphibians. The goal for these models is to identify relationships with native and human footprint landcover types, calculate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance, and predict the probability of occurrence across the province under both the current landscape condition and a reference condition. This information would be used internally, by stakeholders, or the general public to identify where amphibians are occurring the in the province and how they are impacted by land use changes.

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 5. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

The final phase (TBD) will involve publishing the final set of SDM on the ABMI Biodiversity Browser and make the models accessible to anyone. The feedback provided by the experts will be synthesized into a document that highlights which SDM are suitable for public release, improvements to our models that should be incorporated before public release, and long-term objectives for improving our models after public release. In addition, all experts will be provided with an updated technical document describing the species models that will be made publicly available. After our own interal review process of the SDMs, we have identified a following set of topics we are asking experts to consider: -Are there gaps in how ARU recordings are currently summarized? - Do the habitat relationships identified in the SDMs align with your natural history knowledge of these species? - Do the spatial predictions created by the model align with your natural history knowledge of these species current distribution in the province? - Are there key habitat or climate variables you feel are essential to capturing amphibian distributions that are currently not included? - Would you be comfortable using these results to inform your own personal work? We acknowledge that each expert has a unique knowledge base and that they are providing this review due to their interest in amphibians. Therefore, we do not expect experts to provide comments on each of the species or identified topics, and we welcome additional comments on topics not identified above. We would appreciate if all feedback was entered in the Google Form sent with this document by August \\(31^{st}\\), 2021. For those who are interested in the processing of ARU recordings and creation of the SDM, refer to the Materials and Methods section. For those interested in the relationships with native landcover, human footprint, and climate, see the Results and Discussion sections.
