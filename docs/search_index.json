These observations have been incorporated into the ABMIs species distribution modeling (SDM) framework that uses supplementary databases (e.g., Boreal Avian Monitoring Project) and methods (e.g., river fork data from 2007-2015) to identify species habitat relationships with native landcover, human footprint, and climate. In addition to capturing vocalizing song-birds, the ABMI has begun identifying vocalizing amphibians. In collaboration with the Bioacoustic Unit (BU), recordings were collected between 2013 and 2021 and are used to create SDMs for vocalizing amphibians. The goal for these models is to identify relationships with native and human footprint landcover types, calculate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance, and predict the probability of occurrence across the province under both the current landscape condition and a reference condition. This information can be used internally, by stakeholders, or the general public to identify where amphibians are occurring the in the province and how they are impacted by land use changes. 2.2 Amphibians 101 Alberta is home to ten amphibian species: two salamanders, three true frogs, three true toads, one tree frog, and one spadefoot. This unique group of species use their skin to breathe and absorb water and require both aquatic and terrestrial habitats to thrive. During the breeding season, male frogs and toads will begin vocalizing in order to attract mates. The timing of their vocalizations can be dependent on the time of year, local temperature conditions, and even rain events. These vocalizing periods can be captured using ARU, but only reflect part of an amphibians habitat requirements. Unique characteristics within wetlands (e.g., salt concentrations, fish presence) and terrestrial habitats occupied outside of the breeding season are not captured by ARUs. 2.3 Expert Review As amphibians are a high profile taxon within the province, the ABMI is implementing a phased rollout of data related to amphibians: Phase 1 (completed May 1st, 2021) involved updating our Biodiversity Browser to include occurrence maps of all vocalizing amphibian species detected at ABMI sites (https://www.abmi.ca/home/data-analytics/biobrowser-home); Phase 2 (completed September 1st, 2021) involved the development of SDM and an engagement period with local amphibian experts; Phase 3 (completed January 31st, 2022) involved synthesizing the advice identified during the expert review phase and updating the models accordingly. The final phase (TBD) will involve incorporating surveys collected by the Bioacoustic Unit and to publish the final set of SDM on the ABMI Biodiversity Browser. We asked the experts to comment on the following topics: Are there gaps in how ARU recordings are currently summarized? Do the habitat relationships identified in the SDMs align with your natural history knowledge of these species? Do the spatial predictions created by the model align with your natural history knowledge of these species current distribution in the province? Are there key habitat or climate variables you feel are essential to capturing amphibian distributions that are currently not included? Would you be comfortable using these results to inform your own personal work? The feedback provided by the experts was synthesized and issues were addressed whenever possible. These models will be under continual development, so we expect improvements as move amphibian surveys are completed and new data layers are made available. We would like to acknowledge and thank our group of experts as their comments during the review process improved the quality of our species models. "],["data-collection.html", "3 Data Collection 3.1 ARU Deployments 3.2 Processing of vocalization events", " 3 Data Collection 3.1 ARU Deployments The ARU data used to construct these our Species Distribution Models (SDM) have come from the following ABMI surveys; Ecosystem Health sites (2015-2021); Adopt-a-Camera/ARU (2017); Citizen Science ARU (2016); Edge-Interior (2017); Northern Focal Areas (2019-2020); Southern Focal Areas (2020); Amphibian Monitoring (2020); and Operation Grassland (2015). Across the years, there were 3303 unique surveys completed. ARU surveyes conducted by the ABMI between 2015-2021. We also compiled data from the Bioacoustic Units Wetlands surveys (2013-2019). Across the years, there were 1324 unique surveys completed. 3.2 Processing of vocalization events Vocalization data was processed through the WildTrax platform (https://www.wildtrax.ca/). However, due to the differences in how ARU data was collected between projects, and the time of deployment, recordings were standardized using the following procedure: Only observations detected within the first minute of recordings was used. Recordings with high levels of noises due to precipitation, wind conditions, or industrial and background activity were excluded permitting this metadata was available. To replicate the conditions of a midnight survey, we filtered for recording events between 23:30-02:30 hours. We acknowledge that this survey interval may not be optimal for all vocalizing amphibians. Therefore, the calling phenology of each species will be investigated once sufficient data is available. Only species that occurred at greater than 20 ARUs were maintained for analysis. For all species with sufficient data, we assessed the seasonality window of calls by aggregating the percentage of detections across ARUs by Julian calendar day. Local temperature during the recording event and Julian calendar day was used to account for the variation in detectability throughout the survey window. After cleaning the data, there were 12330 unique recordings used for creating SDMs based on vegetation data (Boreal, Foothills, Canadian Shield, Rocky Mountain, and Parkland natural regions), and 4396 unique recordings used for creating SDMs based on soil data (Parkland and Grassland natural regions).

The proportional area of vegetation with broad stand age classes (Table 4.1) and human disturbance classes (Table 4.2) were determined within a 150m buffer by manual interpretation of 1:30,000 aerial photos and SPOT satellite imagery Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (2016). In regions where vegetation classes do not capture the variation in species distributions, the proportional area of soils, classified into seven broad categories, based on a simplified version of the Agricultural Region of Alberta Soil Inventory Database was used (Table 4.1). Table 4.1: Table of vegetation and soil information used to create the species distribution models. Vegetation Age WhiteSpruce, Deciduous, Mixedwood, Pine, Black Spruce 0-9, 10-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60-79, 80-99, 100-119, 120-139, 140+ Treed Fen Shrubby Bog Shrubby Fen Graminoid Fen Treed Swamp Shrubby Swamp Marsh Grass Shrub Soil Loamy Sandy/Loamy Clay Rapid Drain Thin Break Blowouts Other (i.e., Lentic and Lotic) 4.2 Climate Climatic variables were derived from historical weather station data (500 m2 spatial resolution) using the parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model (PRISM) method Daly et al. (2002). As amphibians require water for successful breeding, we also calculated the proportion of water within a 1 km2 buffer around each site. In addition, we included a term to capture if a site was naturally treed (probability of aspen). To enable provincial wide predictions, the above information was also summarizes as a 1 km2 raster for the entire province. Table 4.2: Table of human footprint and climatic information used to create the species distribution models.

We created a set of statistical models (binomial generalized linear models) to relate the relative abundance (presence/absence) of each species to two sets of variables: landcover (vegetation/soil and human footprint) and climate (climate normals and spatial location). This framework allowed us to create models for a large number of species while selecting models for each species that are only as complex as the data supports. For example, the models for a rarer species with few records may not be able to separate different age classes or even broad stand types. In these cases, all age classes or several stand types therefore have the same average value in the resulting habitat model. We assessed model fit using AUC and only present species models with at least moderative predictive ability (AUC &gt; 0.7). 4.3.1 Limitations The explanatory variables are confounded. We have limited ability to separate the effects of each vegetation and human footprint type, and spatial and climate variables. In addition to the challenges generating uncertainty in the individual values, ABMI is not an experimental study. We do not design and manipulate habitat and human footprint types, and simply use what is sampled in the province. As a result, habitat and human footprint types are partially confounded with geographic location and climate variables. Our modeling separate out these effects as best as possible, but without impossible province-wide experiments, we can never be sure how well we have estimated the separate habitat, human footprint and geographic/climate effects. We use the same model set for all species. Our model selection approach weights different models in a model set based on the support provided by each species data. However, we use the same set of models for all species. We currently do not have the resources to develop separate model sets for individual species to benefit from the differences in natural history. There are errors in species identification. Vocalization events from amphibians can be misidentified due to low volume or similarity in species calls. These misidentifications can reduce the accuracy of our models. The vegetation and soil classification is simplified and contains errors. ABMIs vegetation map is compiled from various sources, not all of which cover the entire province. Some layers are less accurate than others. Also, even if individual polygons are accurate, their boundaries may not be precise, and many ABMI sites fall on the edges of vegetation polygons. Resulting error in the vegetation types at sites increases error in the habitat models. Some habitat types may have additional challenges. Grass and shrub sites in the North, for example, may be true permanent open habitats, but the same designation is often given to early seral stages of forested sites after fire. Grass and shrub sites in the prairies are also poorly mapped. Mixedwood stands are also poorly mapped, because they represent a gradient between deciduous and upland conifer stands, which can often change as a stand ages. No other effects of human activities are included in our models. Many sites in the Prairie region are grazed to varying degrees but this information is not available. Thus grazing effects cannot be included in our models, and if grazing differs among native habitat types the effects confound those difference. Any wide-scale human effects, like pollution away from visible human footprint or recent climate change, are also not included in our modeling. Additionally, we only include effects of footprint at the local scale (150m) we sample at. Due to sample size constraints and confounding among variables, we do not include any additional effects that might be caused by human footprint in the larger surrounding area. 4.4 Reporting Regions We summarize our SDM for two reporting regions: 1) The Forested region is composed of the Boreal, Canadian Shield, Rocky Mountain (excluding eastern portion of the Montane region), and Foothills natural regions in addition to the northern portion of the Dry Mixedwood natural subregion. These areas are predominately impacted by forestry footprint; 2) The Prairie region is composed of the Grassland and Parkland natural regions, the southern portion of the Dry Mixedwood natural subregion, and the eastern portion of the Montane natural subregion. These areas were grouped together due to agriculture being the predominate anthropogenic disturbance. The boundaries of the forested and prairie reporting regions used for calculating sector effects.

In addition, they are also known to occupy flooded agricultural fields and small ponds in urban areas as breeding sites. This aligns with the vegetation based SDM where we predicted the species to have moderate to high abundances in both native wetland land cover and human footprint. Interestingly, we predict high abundances of Boreal Chorus Frog in young cut-blocks. These habitats could have altered landscape properties that allow for shallow ephemeral ponds to form, thus creating attractive breeding sites. 5.1 Distribution The Boreal Chorus Frog was very abundant in our data set and was detected at 68.6% of 1648 survey locations.

Sector effect values less than 0% indicate habitat suitability is reduced (predicted related abundance is lower) compared to reference conditions, and values more than 0% indicate habitat suitability is improved (predicted relative abundance is higher) compared to reference conditions. Regional sector effects predict the change in the total regional population by industrial sector for species. This incorporates the area of the footprint, the native habitats where the footprint occurs, and the species response to a particular footprint. Regional population effect values less than 0% indicate a predicted decrease in the regional population due to a particular sectors footprint, and values greater than 0% indicate a predicted increase. 5.7.1 Forested Region We predict that Boreal Chorus Frog has local positive responses to all sectors within this region.

The vegetation based models predicted a positive response to soft linear features and a slight negative relationship with hard linear features (left). The soil based models predicted a strong positive response for soft linear features and no response to hard linear (right).

Regional sector effects predict the change in the total regional population by industrial sector for species. This incorporates the area of the footprint, the native habitats where the footprint occurs, and the species response to a particular footprint. Regional population effect values less than 0% indicate a predicted decrease in the regional population due to a particular sectors footprint, and values greater than 0% indicate a predicted increase. 11.7.1 Forested Region We predict that Western Toad has local positive response to the energy, forestry, and transportation sectors. In addition, we observe a small positive regional effect of the energy and forestry sectors. Regional (left) and local (right) sector effects for Western Toad within the Forested Region 11.7.2 Prairie Region We predict that Western Toad has local positive response to the energy, forestry, and transportation sectors. In addition, we observe a small positive regional effect of the energy and transportation sectors.

This species is associated with deciduous and boreal forests and breeds in shallow, ephemeral wetlands, but may also breed in flooded ditches, roads, and the shallow bays of lakes (https://canadianherpetology.ca). This aligns with both our vegetation and soil based models where we predicted Wood Frog to have high abundances in human footprint features. In addition, our vegetation based models predicted increased abundances in native wetland habitats, as well as young mixedwood and intermediate deciduous forests. 12.1 Distribution The Wood Frog was common in our data set and was detected at 41.9% of 1648 survey locations The occurrence of Wood Frog detected between 2013-2021 at ABMI and BU locations. 12.2 Seasonality Wood Frog was the second most abundance species detected With 1482 unique recordings. Using this information, we were able to determine an optimal survey period. This species was vocalizing between early April to late July, with a peak calling frequency in early May. The frequency of detections across sites aggregated by Julian calendar day. 12.3 Vegetation Models We were able to create a SDM using the vegetation land cover information with moderate fit (AUC = 0.74). The vegetation based model indicated that this species is predicted to have high abundance in native wetland (bogs, fens, swamps) and treed bog habitats in addition to high abundance in crops, rough pasture, tame pasture, cut-blocks, and urban industrial footprints. The predicted relative abundance (bars) of Wood Frog as a function of vegetation and human footprint types in the forested region. Black vertical lines represent 90/% confidence intervals and blue vertical lines are added to forest types where harvesting occurs and shows the predicted species abundance in cut-blocks of various ages. The spatial and climate component indicated positive relationships with longitude and the amount of open water. The spatial and climate components from the vegetation based model for Wood Frog. 12.4 Soil Models We were able to create a SDM using the soil land cover information with moderate fit (AUC = 0.82). The soil based models predicted higher abundance in loamy, sandy/loamy, and clay soil classes and high abundance in all footprint types. There was a strong positive effect between treed and non-treed sites. The predicted relative abundance (bars) of Wood Frog as a function of soil and human footprint types in the prairie region. Black vertical lines represent 90/% confidence intervals. The presence/absence of trees affects the presence and abundance of many species; therefore, separate figures are presented for treed and non-treed sites in the prairie region. The spatial and climate component indicated negative relationships with longitude and a positive relationship with the amount of open water. The spatial and climate components from the soil based model for Wood Frog. 12.5 Linear Features We estimate the impacts of both soft (e.g., seismic lines) and hard (e.g., roads and rails) linear features by comparing the abundance of a species in a completely native habitat to that which 10% of the area is converted to a linear feature type. The vegetation based models predicted a positive response to soft linear features and a slight negative relationship with hard linear features (left). The soil based models predicted a strong positive response for soft linear features and no response to hard linear (right). The vegetation based models indicate that Wood Frog increased in all linear feature types. The soil based models also indicated the same pattern except for a slight increase in Energy Soft Linear features. 12.6 Predicted Abundance Under reference condition, Wood Frog is predicted to be moderately abundant throughout all Natural Regions except areas of the Rocky Mountains and Grasslands (left). Under current landcover conditions (2018 footprint) we observe similar abundance throughout these Natural Regions (right). We predicted increases in suitable habitat for Wood Frog throughout the Parkland Natural Region. This is driven by our models predicting high abundance in agricultural footprint types. The change in predicted relative abundance of Wood Frog as a function of vegetation, soil, human footprint, and space/cliamte across Alberta between reference and current condition (2018 footprint). 12.7 Sector Effects Local sector effects predict the change to species relative abundance inside areas that have been disturbed by each sector (human footprint type) compared to the habitat it replaced (modeled reference condition with no human footprint). Sector effect values less than 0% indicate habitat suitability is reduced (predicted related abundance is lower) compared to reference conditions, and values more than 0% indicate habitat suitability is improved (predicted relative abundance is higher) compared to reference conditions. Regional sector effects predict the change in the total regional population by industrial sector for species. This incorporates the area of the footprint, the native habitats where the footprint occurs, and the species response to a particular footprint. Regional population effect values less than 0% indicate a predicted decrease in the regional population due to a particular sectors footprint, and values greater than 0% indicate a predicted increase. 12.7.1 Forested Region We predict that Wood Frog has local positive response to all sectors within this region. However, this does not translate to the regional effects where we observe small increase. Regional (left) and local (right) sector effects for Wood Frog within the Forested Region 12.7.2 Prairie Region We predict that Wood Frog has local positive responses to all sectors within this region. However, the responses are strongest for agriculture and forestry. In addition, we observe a moderate regional effect of agriculture.
