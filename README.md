# ABMI Amphibian Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) has developed a monitoring program for vocalizing amphibians within Alberta. This repository contains a **bookdown** document (https://abbiodiversity.github.io/Amphibians/) describing how data was collected, processed, and analysed. This document will be update as necessary to reflect changes in available data and modeling procedures. Readers can find the most up-to-date results on the ABMI Biodiversity Browser (https://www.abmi.ca/home/data-analytics/biobrowser-home).

## Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge that this work would not be possible without the dedication of the ABMI staff, both past and present. Without our field staff, geospatial experts, taxonomists, and ecologists, we would not be able to perform this work.
