# ABMI Amphibian Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) has developed a monitoring program for vocalizing amphibians within Alberta. This repository contains a **bookdown** document (https://beallen.github.io/Amphibians/) describing how data was collected, processed, and analysed. This technical document will be updated as necessary while the most recent species results can be found on the ABMI Biodiversity Browser (https://www.abmi.ca/home/data-analytics/biobrowser-home).

## Contact

For any questions regarding the contents of this repository or data access, please contact Brandon Allen at brandon.allen@ualberta.ca.


## Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge that this work would not be possible without the dedication of the past and present ABMI staff. Without our field staff, geospatial experts, and ecologists, we would not be able to perform this work.
